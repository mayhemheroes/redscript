[IMPOSSIBLE_DYN_CAST] At tests/data/dyn-cast-checks.reds:15:11
  let _ = a as ClassC; // Impossible
          ^^^^^^^^^^^
this cast can never succeed, because the types are not related (type mismatch: found ClassC when expected ClassA)

[REDUNDANT_DYN_CAST] At tests/data/dyn-cast-checks.reds:16:11
  let _ = b as ClassA; // Redundant
          ^^^^^^^^^^^
this cast is redundant, you should remove it
